    <h3>Wildcat</h3>
    <p>
      During a visualization of O’Connor’s short story “Parker’s Back,” Hawke’s
      character, Sarah Ruth, tells Casal’s O.E. Parker that she classifies
      people into two categories: irritating and less irritating. Unfortunately,
      that’s how the back-and-forth of “Wildcat” feels, too.
    </p>
    <h3>A Man in Full</h3>
    <p>
      At the end of the day, for such a marquee series with a massive star like
      Daniels, there's little Daniels to actually enjoy. His thick Southern
      drawl drips with conviction, and it's hard to turn away from his
      irresistible charisma.
    </p>
    <h3>The Roundup: Punishment</h3>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the action scenes in “The Roundup: Punishment” also lack
      the antic energy that makes Lee stand out in the first place. There’s a
      lot more boxing choreography but fewer scenes where Seok- demolishes solid
      barriers and glass jaws with hilarious abandon. The concluding fight with
      Baek has its moments, but more often feels skimpy and self-serious.
